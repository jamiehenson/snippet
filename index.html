Alternatively, download the package, and include snippet.css and snippet.js from<code>/dist</code>in an appropriate place within your project. You're gonna need jQuery for this chap. Bower will take take of this, but if you don't use it then just a head's up.</p><p>Then...</p><h2>Basic markup</h2><p>It's very easy to set up one of these boxes. Just include <strong>snippets.css</strong> (or the supplied SASS version) and <strong>snippets.js</strong> in your page, and then whack down the following markup:</p><pre>&lt;div class="snippet-box"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="snippet-content" style="max-height: CUSTOM-BOX-HEIGHT-VALUE"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTENT GOES HERE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="snippet-expander"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>Append whatever styling classes you like to the<code>snippet-expander</code>element. Play about with it above!</p></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p>Made in an effort to seek mild technical gratification in London by<a href="https://github.com/jamiehenson"><strong> Jamie Henson</strong></a>, 2016</p></div></footer></body></html>
